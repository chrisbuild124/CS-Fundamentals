# Algorithms and Data Structures Repository 
Welcome to my Computer Science algorithms and data structures repository. This is a curated collection of essential concepts, algorithms, and data structures that form the backbone of technical interviews, academic study, and real-world software engineering.

## How this repository is structured
I am going through neetcode 150's currated list.

### Progress on Neetcode 150s map:
<img width="3430" height="1650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ee34c73-cfe2-45f7-ab21-d515b39e9152" />


Once I get to 150, I will work on the 250 map (slower pace, of course).
