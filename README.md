# Algorithms and Data Structures Repository 
Welcome to my Computer Science algorithms and data structures repository. This is a collection of essential concepts, algorithms, and data structures that are essential for interviews and academic study. 

## How this repository is structured
I am going through neetcode 150's currated list and Codepath's TIP 103x class 2nd pass. 

### Progress on Neetcode 150s map:

### Progress on TIP 103x's class

Once I get to 150, I will work on the 250 map (slower pace, of course).
