# Algorithms, Data Structures & Misc Repository 
Welcome to my Computer Science algorithms and data structures repository. 
- This is a collection of essential concepts, algorithms, and data structures that are essential for interviews and real world applications.
- In the future, I am going to add system design and OOP patterns. 

## How this repository is structured
I am going through neetcode 250's currated list (150 list completed!) and Codepath's TIP 103x class 2nd pass. 
Additionally, I will add more helpful algorithms that I see outside these lists (including system design).
